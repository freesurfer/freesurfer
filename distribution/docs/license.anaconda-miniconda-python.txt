As of this writing (09/2023), the native Mac silicon build (darwin_arm64) causes
the freesurfer distribution to contain a minimal Anaconda miniconda python
distribution with extra packages installed that have not been pulled from the
URL https://repo.anaconda.com.  This complies with the Anaconda license and
terms of service permitting use and redistribution of the Anaconda python
software without a paid license.

The Anaconda license cited below may be found in the freesurfer tree under paths like:
$FRESURFER_HOME/python/miniconda3_apple_dist/py3_8_13/LICENSE.txt

The copy of the LICENSE.txt file contained within the python distribution at the
location listed above may change from time to time and so may be more recent
compared to the license text listed here (for completeness).
