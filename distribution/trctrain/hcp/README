This directory contains the manually labeled white-matter
pathways and FreeSurfer segmentations that are used as
training data for TRACULA. The diffusion-weighted and
T1-weighted image data were collected and shared by the
MGH/USC Human Connectome Project, with funding from the
NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research (U01-MH093765).
