# instructions for using the surface-based V1 probabilistic atlas

1) the directory containing this README (V1_average) should be linked
into the SUBJECTS_DIR containing the subjects for which V1 is to be
predicted.

EXAMPLE:

if the V1_average directory is 
/usr/local/freesurfer/subjects/V1_average
and the target subjects are in 
/usr/local/data/subjects/v1_predict
then link the V1_average directory using the command:
$ ln -sf /usr/local/freesurfer/subjects/V1_average /usr/local/data/subjects/v1_predict/

2) use the script predict_v1.sh (in the scripts directory) 

EXAMPLE:

to predict V1 location for subjects s1, s2, and s3 use the command:

$ /usr/local/freesurfer/subjects/V1_average/scripts/predict_v1.sh s1 s2 s3

V1_average.1.1.tgz - 11/10/2008 - v1.1, bug fix and method improvements:
                                  bug fix: 
                                    - the default warping parms were being 
                                    used instead of the ones found to be 
                                    best for V1
                                  improvements: 
                                    - the best probability threshold was 
                                    changed from 0.5 (default guess) to 0.8 
                                    (determined by finding the min error 
                                    between the predicted to actual 
                                    boundaries on the zilles brains)
                                    - added the option of using a template 
                                    different than the one created from the 
                                    ex vivo recons.
