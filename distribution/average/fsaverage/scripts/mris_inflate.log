The fsaverage ?h.inflated surfaces required a bit more inflation
after they were created using the make_average_subject utility.
The results of make_average_subject (actually make_average_surface)
are found in surf/?h.inflated_pre (where ?h.inflated was renamed to
?h.inflated_pre).

The following was run to inflate:

  mris_inflate -n 15 -f 1e-8 ./lh.smoothwm ./lh.inflated

and

  mris_inflate -n 15 -f 1e-8 ./rh.smoothwm ./rh.inflated
