          mris_curvature_stats      

    SYNOPSIS        

          mris_curvature_stats [options] 			\\
          	<subjectName> <hemi> [<curvFile1> ... <curvFileN] 

    DESCRIPTION        

          In its simplest usage, 'mris_curvature_stats' will compute a set
	  of statistics on its input <curvFile>. These statistics are the
	  mean and standard deviation of the particular curvature on the 
	  surface, as well as the results from several surface-based 
	  integrals.

          Additionally, 'mris_curvature_stats' can report the max/min 
          curvature values, and compute a simple histogram based on  
          all curvature values.       

          Curvatures can also be normalised and constrained to a given 
          range before computation.     

          Principle curvature (K, H, k1 and k2) calculations on a surface
	  structure can also be performed, as well as several functions
	  derived from k1 and k2.

          Finally, all output to the console, as well as any new  
          curvatures that result from the above calculations can be 
          saved to a series of text and binary-curvature files.  

 	  PRINCIPLE CURVATURES AND FUNCTIONS

	  Given a surface file, 'mris_curvature_stats' can also compute
	  all the principle curvatures relating to each point on the 
	  surface as well as several functions of these principle 
	  curvatures.

	  To calculate these principle curvatures, use a '-G' flag on the
	  command line. In such an instance, you do need (nor probably even 
	  want) any <curvFile> arguments. The following principle curvatures
	  and derived measures are calculated (and statistics on each are
	  presented) for each vertex on the surface:

	  		k1 	maximum curvature
	  		k2 	minimum curvature	  
	  		K 	Gaussian 	= k1*k2
	  		H	Mean 		= 0.5*(k1+k2)
          		C	Curvedness 	= sqrt(0.5*(k1*k1+k2*k2))
			S	Sharpness 	= (k1 - k2)^2
	  		BE	Bending Energy 	= k1*k1 + k2*k2
			SI	Shape Index	= atan((k1+k2)/(k2-k1))
	  
	  Note that the SI is not calculated by default due to some issues
	  with atan calculations. Use the '--shapeIndex' flag on the command
	  line to force SI.

	  In addition, if a '--writeCurvatureFiles' is specified, each of the
	  above are written to a FreeSurfer format curvature file.

	  Note that there are two methods to calculate principle curvatures. 
	  The first method is based on calculating the Second Fundamental
	  Form, and is the method used by 'mris_anatomical_stats'. This
	  approach can be selected by the '--continuous' command line
	  argument. This method, however, suffers occassionally from
	  accuracy problems and can have very large curvature outliers.

	  A slower, more accurate method using discrete methods is available
       	  and can be selected with the '--discrete' command line argument.
	  This is in fact the default mode for 'mris_curvature_stats'.

    SURFACE INTEGRALS

	  The surface integrals for a given curvature map are filtered/modified
	  in several ways.

    		- 'natural':	no change/filtering on the vertex curv values
    		- 'abs':	the fabs(...) of each vertex curv value
    		- 'pos':	process only the positive vertex curv values 
    		- 'neg':	process only the negative vertex curv values
    	 
	  In addition, the following qualifiers are also evaluated:
    		- 'Mean':	the integral normalized to number of vertices
    		- 'AreaNorm':	the integral value normalized to unit surface

    OPTIONS         

    [-a <numberOfAverages]      

          Average the curvature <numberOfAverages> times.   

    [-G] [--discrete] [--continuous] [--signedPrinciples]

	  Calculate the principle curvatures ('-G'). The calculation method
	  used can be specified explicitly as '--discrete' which is slower
	  but more accurate, or as '--continuous' which will result in
	  measures similar to 'mris_anatomical_stats'.

	  Note that the default assumes '--discrete'. If you specify both
	  '--continuous' and '--discrete', the system will revert to its
	  default, i.e. '--discrete', behaviour.

	
	  In the '--discrete' mode, 'mris_curvature_stats' solves for


    [--shapeIndex]

	  The 'Shape Index' curvature map can be problematic due to
	  issues with some atan calculations. By default the shape index
	  is not calculated. Use this flag to force shape index
	  calculations.

    [-o <outputFileStem>]      

          Save processing results to a series of files. This includes 
          condensed text output, histogram files (MatLAB friendly) 
          and curvature files.      

          The actual files that are saved depends on which additional 
          calculation flags have been specified (i.e. normalisation, 
          Gaussian / Mean, scaling).     

          In the case when a Gaussian/Mean calculation has been   
          performed, 'mris_curvature_stats' will act in a manner  
          similar to 'mris_curvature -w'.  Note though that though the 
          name of the curvature files that are created are different,  
          the contents are identical to 'mris_curvature -w' created files.

          All possible files that can be saved are:
	  (where	O	= <outputFileStem>
			H	= <hemisphere>
			S	= <surface>
			C	= <curvature>)   

          <O> 			Log only a single  mean+-sigma. If several 
          			curvature files have been specified, log the 
				mean+-sigma across all the curvatures. Note 
				also that this file is *appended* for each 
				new run. 
          <OHSC>.log		Full output, i.e the output of each curvature 
				file mean +- sigma, as well as min/max and
				surface integrals   
          <OHS>.raw.hist  	Raw histogram file. By 'raw' is implied that 
				the curvature has not been further processed 
          			in any manner.  
          <OHS>.norm.hist  	Normalised histogram file 
          <OHS>.scaled.hist 	Scaled histogram file  
          <OHS>.K.hist  	Gaussian histogram file 
          <OHS>.H.hist  	Mean histogram file 
	  <OHS>.k1.hist		k1 histogram file 
	  <OHS>.k2.hist		k2 histogram file 
	  <OHS>.C.hist		C 'curvedness' histogram file 
	  <OHS>.S.hist		S 'sharpness' histogram file 
	  <OHS>.BE.hist		BE 'bending energy' histogram file 

          <HS>.norm.crv   	Normalised curv file	('-n')   
          <HS>.scaled.crv  	Scaled curv file	('-c' or '-d' '-e')  
          <HS>.K.crv   		Gaussian curv file  	('-G')
          <HS>.H.crv   		Mean curv file  	('-G')
          <HS>.k1.crv   	k1 curv file  		('-G')
          <HS>.k2.crv   	k2 curv file  		('-G')
          <HS>.S.crv   		S curv file  		('-G')
          <HS>.C.crv   		C curv file  		('-G')
          <HS>.BE.crv   	BE curv file  		('-G')

	  (The above *.crv files can also be created with a 
	  '--writeCurvatureFiles' flag)

          Note that curvature files are saved to 

			$SUBJECTS_DIR/<subjectname>/surf 

	  and *not* to the current working directory.   

    [-h <numberOfBins>] [-p <numberOfBins]    

          If specified, prepare a histogram over the range of curvature 
          values, using <numberOfBins> buckets. These are dumped to 
          stdout.        

          If '-p' is used, then the histogram is expressed as a   
          percentage.       

          Note that this histogram, working off float values and float 
          boundaries, can suffer from rounding errors! There might be 
          instances when a very few (on average) curvature values might 
          not be sorted.       

          The histogram behaviour can be further tuned with the   
          following:       

    [-b <binSize>] [-i <binStartCurvature] [-j <binEndCurvature] 

          These arguments are only processed iff a '-h <numberOfBins>' 
          has also been specified. By default, <binSize> is defined as 

          (maxCurvature - minCurvature) / <numberOfBins>  

          The '-b' option allows the user to specify an arbitrary  
          <binSize>. This is most useful when used in conjunction with 
          the '-i <binStartCurvature>' option, which starts the histogram 
          not at (minCurvature), but at <binStartCurvature>. So, if  
          a histogram reveals that most values seem confined to a very 
          narrow range, the '-b' and '-i' allow the user to 'zoom in' 
          to this range and expand.     

          If <binStartCurvature> < (minCurvature), then regardless 
          of its current value, <binStartCurvature> = (minCurvature). 
          Also, if (<binStartCurvature> + <binSize>*<numberOfBins> >) 
          (maxCurvature), an error is raised and processing aborts. 

          The '-j' allows the user to specify an optional end  
          value for the histogram. Using '-i' and '-j' together  
          are the most convenient ways to zoom into a region of interest 
          in a histogram.       

    [-l <labelFileName>]      

          Constrain statistics to the region defined in <labelFileName>. 

    [-m]        

          Output min / max information for the processed curvature. 

    [-n]        

          Normalise the curvature before computation. Normalisation 
          takes precedence over scaling, so if '-n' is specified  
          in conjunction with '-c' or '-smin'/'-smax' it will  
          override the effects of the scaling.    

          If specified in conjunction with '-o <outputFileStem>'  
          will also create a curvature file with these values.  

    [-s <summaryCondition>]      
          
          Write out stats as <summaryCondition>.    
          
    [-d <minCurvature> -e <maxCurvature>]    

          Scale curvature values between <minCurvature> and   
          <maxCurvature>. If the minimum curvature is greater  
          than the maximum curvature, or if either is    
          unspecified, these flags are ignored.    

          This scale computation takes precedence over '-c' scaling. 

          Note also that the final scaling bounds might not correspond 
          to <minCurvature>... <maxCurvature> since values are scaled 
          across this range so as to preserve the original mean profile. 

          If specified in conjunction with '-o <outputFileStem>'  
          will also create a curvature file with these values.  

    [-c <factor>]       

          Scale curvature values with <factor>. The mean of the   
          original curvature is conserved (and the sigma increases 
          with <factor>).       

    [-version]        

          Print out version number.     
          
    [-z <vertexIndex>]       

          Sets the curvature values at that index to zero. The   
          'raw' curvature, as well as the Gaussian and Mean curvatures 
          are set to zero, and min/max values are recomputed.  

          This is useful in cases when outliers in the data (particularly 
          evident in Gaussian calcuations) skew mean and sigma values. 

    [-q <maxUlps>]       

          The <maxUlps> is used to toggle a more rigorous floating point 
          comparison operation in the histogram function. Comparing  
          float values for sorting into bins can at times fail due to 
          number precision issues. If, over the range of comparison 
          some curvature values are not sorted, add <maxUlps>.  

          This adds extra function calls to AlmostEqual2sComplement(..) 
          for float comparisons and improves the general accuracy, at  
          a very slight performance penalty.    

          You will most likely never have to use this argument, and is  
          for advanced use only.      

    NOTES         

          It is important to note that some combinations of the command 
          line parameters are somewhat meaningless, such as normalising 
          a 'sulc' curvature file (since it's normalised by definition). 

    EXAMPLES        

    $>mris_curvature_stats 801_recon rh curv    

          For subject '801_recon', determine the mean+-sigma and surface
	  integrals for the curvature file 'curv' on the right hemisphere.   

    $>mris_curvature_stats -m 801_recon rh curv    

          Same as above, but print the min/max curvature values  
          across the surface.      

    $>mris_curvature_stats -h 20 -m 801_recon rh curv   

          Same as above, and also print a histogram of curvature   
          values over the min/max range, using 20 bins. By replacing 
          the '-h' with '-p', print the histogram as a percentage. 

    $>mris_curvature_stats -h 20 -b 0.01 -i -0.1 -m 801_recon rh curv 
    $>mris_curvature_stats -h 20 -i -0.1  -j 0.1 -m 801_recon rh curv 

          Same as above, but this time constrain the histogram to the 20  
          bins from -0.1 to 0.1, with a bin size of 0.01.   

          Note that the count / percentage values are taken across the    
          total curvature range and not the constrained window defined  
          by the '-i' and '-b' arguments.     

    $>mris_curvature_stats -G 801_recon rh   

	  Calculate all the second order measures for the right hemisphere
	  of subject '801_recon'. By default, the 'smoothwm' surface is
	  selected.

    $>mris_curvature_stats -G -F inflated 801_recon rh   

	  Same as above, but use the 'inflated' surface.

    $>mris_curvature_stats -h 10 -G -m 801_recon rh  

          Same as above, with the addition of a histogram and min/max
	  curvatures for all the second order measures.

    $>mris_curvature_stats -h 10 -G -m -o foo 801_recon rh      

          Generate several output text files using the stem 'foo' that 
	  capture the min/max and histograms for each curvature processed. 
	  Also create new second order curvature files.    

          In this case, the curvature files created are called:  

          		rh.smoothwm.K.crv     
          		rh.smoothwm.H.crv     
          		rh.smoothwm.k1.crv     
          		rh.smoothwm.k2.crv     
          		rh.smoothwm.S.crv     
          		rh.smoothwm.C.crv     
          		rh.smoothwm.BE.crv     

          and are saved to the $SUBJECTS_DIR/<subjectname>/surf directory. 
          These can be re-read by 'mris_curvature_stats' using   

    $>mris_curvature_stats -m 801_recon rh 		\\
			smoothwm.K.crv			\\   
			smoothwm.H.crv			\\   
			smoothwm.k1.crv			\\   
			smoothwm.k2.crv   		\\
			smoothwm.S.crv			\\   
			smoothwm.C.crv			\\   
			smoothwm.BE.crv			\\   

    ADVANCED EXAMPLES       

          'mris_curvature_stats' can also provide some useful side  
          effects. Reading in a curvature, and applying any calculation 
          to it (scaling, gaussian, etc.) can result in data that  
          can be visualised quite well in a tool such as 'tksurfer'. 

          Consider the normal curvature display in 'tksurfer', which 
          is usually quite dark due to the dynamic range of the display. 
          We can considerably improve the brightness by scaling a  
          curvature file and rendering the resultant in 'tksurfer'. 

          First, take an arbitrary curvature, apply a scale factor, 
          and an output filestem:      

    $>mris_curvature_stats --writeCurvatureFiles -c 10 801_recon rh curv   

          This scales each curvature value by 10. A new curvature file 
          is saved in       

          	$SUBJECTS_DIR/801_recon/surf/rh.smoothwm.scaled.crv 

          Comparing the two curvatures in 'tksurfer' will clearly show 
          the scaled file as much brighter.    

          Similarly, the Gaussian curvature can be processed, scaled, and 
          displayed, yielding very useful visual information. First  
          create and save the principle curvature based files:

    $>mris_curvature_stats --writeCurvatureFiles -G 801_recon rh curv 

	  This command will create Gaussian and Mean curvature files in the 
          $SUBJECTS_DIR/<subjectName>/surf directory:     

          		rh.smoothwm.K.crv     
          		rh.smoothwm.H.crv     

          Now, process the created Gaussian with the scaled curvature: 

    $>mris_curvature_stats --writeCurvatureFiles -c 10 	\\
			801_recon rh smoothwm.K.crv 

          The final scaled Gaussian curvature is saved to (again in the
	  $SUBJECTS_DIR/801_recon/surf directory): 

          		rh.smoothwm.scaled.crv   

          which is a much better candidate to view in 'tksurfer' than 
          the original Gaussian curvature file.
