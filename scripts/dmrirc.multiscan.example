# dmrirc.multiscan.example
#
# This example sets up a TRACULA analysis for a cross-sectional study where
# there are multiple diffusion scans per subject. The different diffusion scans
# in a session may be acquired with different gradient direction sets or be
# repetitions of the same direction set; they may be acquired with reverse
# phase-encode directions (in which case they can be used for B0 distortion
# correction) or with the same phase-encode direction (in which case they can
# still be combined, but cannot be used for distortion correction).
# - If you have longitudinal data, see *.long.*example
# - If you have only one cross-sectional scan per subject, see dmrirc.example
#
# This file contains commands that will be run by trac-all before an analysis.
# It is used to set all parameters needed for the analysis.
#
# Remove a parameter from your dmrirc file if you want use the default value.
# Parameters that don't have default values must be specified.
#
# Any other commands that you might want to run before an analysis can be added
# to this file.
