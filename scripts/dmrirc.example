# dmrirc.example
#
# This file contains commands that will be run by trac-all before an analysis.
# It is used to set all parameters needed for the analysis.
#
# Remove a parameter from your dmrirc file if you want use the default value.
# Parameters that don't have default values must be specified.
#
# Any other commands that you might want to run before an analysis can be added
# to this file.
