# 1. mri_cal_normalize
# Runs a joint intensity normalization for each subject.
# Input:
#  - aligned nu.mgz (or norm.mgz) from all time points
#  - aligned aseg.mgz (mapped from cross) for all time points
#  - brainmask.mgz and talairach.m3z from the base
#  - the FS global GCA atlas
# Outputs:
#  - a new norm (longtp/<tpid>/norm.long.s<sigma>.mgz) for each time point.
#
# Internally it does:
# a) scale all images (histo scaling)
# b) gca find all samples
# c) foreach region and each structure find control points
# d) discard unlikely control points
# e) discard control points with different labels (based on asegs)
# f) normalize all channels of this region with common set of control points
# g) now do joint cross time normalization (weighted average, parzen window)
# Attention: aseg.mgz from cross are mapped at the beginning of the base stream, 
# so cross needs to be finished before processing base!
# also base needs to be processed up to -careg

# (which should be true in a longitudinal study). If not true, it may make 
# sense to do a atlas renormalization for each scanner/protocol (not implemented).
