These files are concerned with the generation of surfaces
(triangulations) from a volume (MRI).

*mri_mc: it generates a marching cubes triangulation that is
 topologically consistent with a specific choice of connectivity. By
 default, this program will only keep the main connected component.


*mris_extract_main_component: extract the main connected component
 from a surface.

*build_MC_table: build the marching cubes table.
