# This wrapper script facilitates setup and use of SynthMorph containers by
# pulling them from the Docker Hub and mounting the host directory defined by
# environment variable SUBJECTS_DIR to /mnt in the container. Invoke the script
# just like `mri_synthmorph` in FreeSurfer, with one exception: you can only
# read and write data under SUBJECTS_DIR, which will be the working directory
# in the container. If unset, SUBJECTS_DIR defaults to your current directory.
# This means you can access relative paths under your working directory without
# setting SUBJECTS_DIR. In other words, SUBJECTS_DIR sets the working directory
# for SynthMorph, and you can specify paths relative to it.
