# For a new dev/ environment, before running configure, 
# and anytime after a Makefile.am file has changed, 
# the following commands must be executed within the 
# dev/ directory:

set cmd1=(rm -rf autom4te.cache)
set cmd2=(aclocal)
if ( "`uname -s`" == "Darwin" ) then 
    set cmd3=(glibtoolize --force)
else
    set cmd3=(libtoolize --force)
endif
set cmd4=(autoreconf --force)
#automake Note: autoreconf --force runs automake
set cmd5=(autoconf)

echo $cmd1
$cmd1
echo $cmd2
$cmd2
echo $cmd3
$cmd3
echo $cmd4
$cmd4
echo $cmd5
$cmd5

# The first three commands create the platform specific 
# tools needed by configure (use glibtoolize on the Mac 
# in place of libtoolize). These platform specific tools 
# are placed in the dev/config directory. 
# Autoreconf --force and automake create the Makefile.in 
# files from the Makefile.am files in each directory. 
# Following successful execution of these commands, the 
# configure command can be executed.
