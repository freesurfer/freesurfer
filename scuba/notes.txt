BRUCE'S LIST:::

x data collection transform 
x markers
- b/c controled by mouse, perhaps mod+mouse when nav tool is on
x import/export control points

BUGS:::
- tabbing when in console switches frame, disable?
- brings up tkcon window briefly when booting
- markers and cursor draw at different slices when zoomed in
- color picker window, open twice?
- test_ScubaFrame
- oblique viewing planes
  - lines not picked up (only first vertex is checked)
  - circle brush doesn't work in proper plane
  - fill not in view plane
- new value stuff doesn't show up unless you click Tools panel first, then click voxelEditing button


FUTURE IDEAS:::

Save Scene
 - save a script file to automatically load in data and set up view state like current one

nav tools draw onscreen sliders for feedback
 - on mouse down with right tool, draw scale bar
 - function to translate v position into modifcation value
 - start at mouse point, use expo scale towards edge for min/max values
