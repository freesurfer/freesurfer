Instructions for registering a t1-epi structural with t1-spgr structural.
Douglas N. Greve
August 13, 1999

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background: Each voxel in the t1-epi must be mapped to a voxel in the
high-resolution structural t1-spgr.  Typically, the t1-epi has 16
slices, each 128x128 whereas the hi-res structs are 256x256x256.  The
t1-epi usually encompasses a smaller portion of the brain.  There are
8 parameters that need to be specified to realize the transformation:
translation of x, y, z (3), rotation about x, y, z (3), and stretching
in the t1-epi xz plane and y plane (2).  The rotation and translation
are part of a rigid-body transformation. The register program is used
to assist in visually aligning these two brain images.

NOTE: You should have the following lines in your .cshrc file
setenv SUBJECTS_DIR  /homes/nmrnew/home/inverse/subjects
setenv TKSURFER_TCL /homes/nmrnew/home/inverse/mri/lib/tcl

You should also have the following in your path:
/homes/nmrnew/home/inverse/mri/bin

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
To run the register program:

1. cd to the t1-epi directory.
2. Create a default register.dat file (see below)
3. Create a default analyse.dat file (see below)
4. Run register (from an SGI only).
5. After 1-2 minutes, a window will appear.
6. Use keypress commands to visually align the structural and 
   t1-epi brains (see  below for a list of keypress commands).
6. Save the results back to register.dat using the "T" keypress
   command.

------------------------------------
register.dat has the following form:
------------------------------------
SubjectName
xzscale
yscale
intensity
tm11 tm12 tm13 tm14
tm12 tm22 tm23 tm24
tm13 tm32 tm33 tm34
tm14 tm42 tm43 tm44

- - - - - - - - - - -- - -- - - - - - - --- - - - - -   -- - - 
SubjectName - the name of the subject in the functional experiment
as found in the $SUBJECTS_DIR structural directory.  This tells
register where the structural images are.

xzscale - scaling factor applied to the distance between in-plane 
pixels of the t1-epi.  Default: distance between pixels, typically
3.125 for t1-epi.

yscale - scaling factor applied to the distance between planes
of the t1-epi. Default: distance between planes, typically 7 for
t1-epi.

intensity - brightness of the t1-epi in the register display window.
This only affects how the t1-epi appears on the screen.  It does not
affect the registration itself.

tmij - i,jth component of the transformation matrix used to map
t1-epi voxel indices into structural indices.  Includes
translation and rotation.  The initial assignment of this matrix
is very important to make registration easier.  For slices whose
primary orientation is in the axial plane, starting at the bottom of
the brain and going to the top, the following matrix is a good place 
to start:

1 0 0 0
0 0 1 0
0 1 0 0
0 0 0 1

--------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------
analyse.dat has the following form:
------------------------------------
placeholder
t1filenametemplate
nt1slices nperslice
xdim_2 ydim_2
------------------------------------

placeholder - ignored.  A single string must be here.

t1filenametemplate - path,  stem, and format string of t1-epi
images.  Eg, 990109NH/image/3/990109NH_02361_00003_00003_00001_001_%03d.bshort

nt1slices - number of t1-epi slices (usually 16)

nperslice - number of slices for each nt1slice (usually 1)

xdim_2 - number of in-plane rows and columns for the t1-epi (usually 128).

ydim_2 - xdim_2

---------------------------------------------------------------------
register key-press commands:

x - view sagittal plane
y - view axial
z - view coronal

1 - view structural
2 - view t1-epi (positive contrast)
3 - view t1-epi (negative contrast)
0 - swap between last two views

Up/Down Arrow - increase/decrease intensity

Left/Right Arrow - view next image in current plane

Left-Mouse - change center-view location of non-current planes

p or . - translate current t1-epi up or down (shift for larger)

l or ; - translate current t1-epi left or right (shift for larger)

[ or ] - rotate current t1-epi  (shift for larger)

Insert or Delete - Expand or Contract Sagittal plane (scale)

Home or End - Expand or Contract Axial plane (scale)

PageUp or PageDown - Expand/Contract Coronal plane (scale)

T - save current parameters (overwrite initial register.dat file)

ESC - exit

M - mirror, ie, flip image about the vertical axis.

Tips for Registering:

1.  Registering is not a particularly easy procedure; unfortunately,
the register program is a bit quirky and does not make the task that
much easier.  It is also a little bit slow. The t1-epi will be highly
pixelated, making registration that much more difficult.  There are
plans to make a less burdensome registration routine, but as of the
writing of this document, the software is not in place yet.

2.  Starting with a "good" registration matrix can save a tremendous
amount of time and aggravation.

3.  The basic technique is to use the "0" keypress command to quickly 
flip between the t1-epi and the structural and then to look for
apparent motion between the two images.

4.  The "0" keypress command will flip between the last two
viewed images.  It does not necessarily flip between the t1-epi and 
the structural, which is what you will want.  To force this, hit "1"
to display the structural, then hit "2" to display the t1-epi. Now
hitting "0" will flip between the t1-epi and the structural.

5.  Many people find that it is easier to use a smaller display window
as this reduces the effect of pixelation.
