The {\bf paradigm file format} is a method of representing the
sequence of stimulus presentations.  Paradigm files are a text files
with at least two columns.  The first column indicates the time (in
seconds) at which a stimulus is/was to be presented, where time zero
is implicitly assumed to be the time of the first data acquisition of
the run. The second column indicates the identification number of the
type of stimulus presented.  Each type has its own unique number, with
identification number 0 being reserved for the null condition.  

An example paradigm file is shown below.  There are four stimulus
types (Ids: 0, 1, 2, and 3).  Stimulus type 1 is presented
simultaneously with the acquisition of the first slice of the run.
Stimulus type 2 is presented 4 seconds later and again 2 seconds after
that. Stimulus type 3 is presented 8 seconds after the first
acquisition, etc.
