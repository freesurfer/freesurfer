# getformat_from_stem - determines format from a stem by appending
# various format extensions and checking whether the file exists.
# For this reason, the actual format returned will depend upon
# whether the sequences of formats tried if multiple formats for 
# the same stem are present.
#
# Return: format extension and exit 0. If fails, then exits 1.
#
# As a convenience, you can spec the format to try as the 2nd arg.
# If the stem.fmt does not exist, then exit 1. Otherwise exit 0
# and echoes the given fmt to the terminal. This just helps to
# cut out a few lines of code from the calling program.
