BEGINHELP

Measures ghost suppression for EPI functional scans.


REQUIRED ARGUMENTS

--i instem

Stem of functional data from which the ghosting measure is computed. This 
can have one or more frames. This is the only compulsary argument.

OPTIONAL ARUGMENTS

--s sumfile

Save summary into sumfile. Default is instem.ghost.sum. See SUMMARY
MEASURES below. Note: log file is saved as sumfile.log

--tmp tmpdir

Save intermediate results in tmpdir. By default the temporary directory
is /tmp/ghostdet.tmp.procid is deleted by default. When explicitly 
specified with --tmp, tmpdir will not be deleted (ie, implies --nocleanup). 
If you want tmpdir to be deleted, specify --cleanup after --tmp.

--nocleanup

Do not delete temporary directory and files.

--cleanup

Delete temporary directory and files. Does this auotmatically unless --tmp.

SUMMARY MEASURES

The summary file is a report of the ghost detection analysis. It contains 
both output results and the input parameters. See ALGORITHM below for
an explanation of how these parameters are used. It looks like this:

brain_mean 6398.47
ghost_mean 418.601
air_mean   92.8722
brain_ghost_ratio 15.2854
brain_air_ratio   68.8955
ghost_air_ratio   4.50729
n_air     27509
n_brain    2192
head_thresh   0.05
n_head_dilate 3
brain_thresh  0.5
n_brain_erode 3
n_air_erode   3

brain_mean - mean of the subset of voxels inside the brain voxels
  chosen for the analysis. Each voxel in the brain has a corresponding
  voxel in the ghost.

ghost_mean - mean of the voxels inside the ghost voxels chosen for the
  analysis. Each voxel in the ghost has a corresponding voxel in the
  brain.

air_mean - mean of the voxels outside both the head and the ghost of 
  the head.

brain_ghost_ratio - ratio of the mean of the brain to the mean of the
  ghost.  This is the primary measure of ghost suppression.

brain_air_ratio - ratio of the mean of the brain to the mean of the
  air.  This is the ideal value of upper limit to the
  brain_ghost_ratio.

ghost_air_ratio - ratio of the mean of the ghost to the mean of the
  air.  This ratio should be 1 ideally.

n_air - number of voxels in the air.

n_brain - number of voxels in the subset of the brain used for the
  analysis.  Note: this should NOT be interpreted as brain volume. See
  below for how this is computed. Note: each brain voxels has a
  corresponding ghost voxel, so the number of ghost voxels is equal to
  the number of brain voxels.

head_thresh - fraction of grand mean to use to initially segment the
  head.  This threshold is passed to FSL BET. Default is 0.05.

n_head_dilate - the head mask created by BET is dilated (grown) by
  this number of voxels. Default is 3.

brain_thresh - fraction of grand mean to use to initially segment the
  brain.  This threshold is passed to FSL BET. Default is 0.5.

n_brain_erode - the brain mask created by BET is eroded (shrunk) by
  this number of voxels. Default is 3.

n_air_erode - the air mask is eroded (shrunk) by this number of
  voxels.  Default is 3.  

ALGORITHM

The basic measure of ghosting is to compare the average intensity in
the head with that in the ghost. For an N/2 ghost, a voxel in the head
will map to another voxel in the slice. This ghost voxel will be in
the same column as the original voxel. Its row will be that of the
original plus N/2. If this puts it out of the slice, then it is
wrapped around. There are voxels where the ghost and the head will
overlap, and we do not want to consider these voxels because it would
skew the results. We want head-ghost voxel pairs for which the ghost
voxel is absolutely not in any tissue. A simple intensity-based
segmentation of the head often fails because there is some tissue (eg
the skull) that can have an intensity comparable to the ghost, and
these areas cannot be eliminated purely based on intensity without
eliminating the ghost itself.  In addition to determining which voxels
are head and ghost, it is nice to know which voxels are "air". The
average in the air will give a lower limit that the ghost can
achieve. Note that the average air intensity will always be non-zero
because of the nature of k-space reconstruction.

Here is the algorthm this program uses to choose the subset of voxels
for brain, ghost, and air.

1. Average the functional volume into a single volume. All the masks
are created based on this volume. In the tmpdir, this will be the fmn
volume.

2. Create a head mask. The first stage is to run BET with a low
threshold of 0.05 (head_thresh) to make sure that it gets most of the
head. BET has constraints that force the mask to have a smooth surface
and be connected. This usually does not capture the skull or non-brain
tissue, so the initial head mask is grown (dilated) by 3 voxels
(n_head_dilate) so as to expand out to the skull. In the tmpdir, this
will be the head volume.

3. Create a mask of the ghost of the head. This is done by mapping the
the head mask by N/2 rows. In the tmpdir, this will be the headghost
volume.

4. Create a mask of the air. These are all the voxels that do not fall
into either the head or the headghost. In addition, the initial air
mask is eroded (shrunk) by 3 voxels (n_air_erode) to make sure that
it does not contain any tissue. In the tmpdir, this will be the air
volume.

5. Create an initial brain mask. The first stage is to run BET with a
high threshold of 0.5 (brain_thresh) to make sure that it gets only
brain.  This brain mask is then eroded (shrunk) by 3 voxels
(n_brain_erode) to assure that it contains no low-intensity areas.

6. Create the brain ghost and final brain mask. The brain ghost is
created by wrapping the intial brain mask by N/2. Voxels that are in
both the brain and ghost are eliminated from both masks. The resulting
brain mask is saved as brain in tmpdir. The resulting ghost mask is
saved as ghost in tmpdir.
