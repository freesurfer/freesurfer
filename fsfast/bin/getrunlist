# getrunlist - can be run in two ways:
#
# (1) without runlistfile - finds all the subdirectories 
#     of dir with name of the form %03d and echos them 
#     to stdout. If dir does not exist or there are no
#     runs, exits with status 1. 
#
# (2) with runlistfile - opens the run list file, reads
#     the runs, and checks that all runs exist in dir.
#     If dir does not exist or all the runs do not exist,
#     exits with status 1.
