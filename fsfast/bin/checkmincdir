# checkmincdir
#
# Purpose: given a directory with minc files from a single exam
# and a list of run numbers, determines whether all the expected 
# minc files are there and if they are about the right size. 
# This is supposed to help determine if/when ima2mnc has finished 
# converting all the ima files into minc. If there's something
# wrong, a message is printed to stdout and a non-zero status is
# returned. If successful, nothing is printed and 0 is returned.
#
# "img-getrunlist' can be used to get the list of run numbers 
# directly from the ima directory.
