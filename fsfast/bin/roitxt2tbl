#
# Converts the text files created by func2roi-sess into a table
# with one column so that it is easier to read into external 
# statistics programs. Each row has the following meaning:
#
# 1. nlabel - number of functional voxels in the label specified
#      when running func2roi-sess. This number is zero if no label 
#      is specified.       
# 2. nroi - number of functional voxels in the final ROI (intersection
#      of label and mask)
# 3. offset - mean of the offsets in each voxel of the ROI. This
#      can be used to compute percent signal change.
# 4. eresstd - mean of the standard deviations of the residual error
#      at each voxel in the ROI.
# 5. DOF - degrees of freedom in eresstd
# 6. TER - for event-related studies, this is the time between estimates
#      that come later. This can be helpful for plotting.
# 7. tPreStim - for event-related studies, this is the prestimulus
#      window. This can be helpful for plotting.
# 8. nconditions - number of non-null conditions
# 9. nestspercond - number of estimates per condition
# 10-N. These are the estimates for each condition.  There  will be a
#    block for each condition. Each block is length nestspercond.
